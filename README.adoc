NOTE: Please pay attention to these caveats:

- Depends on joyqi/typecho:nightly-php8.0-alpine, a nightly build, which may contain bugs
- Due to the way Railway works, there is no persistent file storage, so are uploads
- Themes and plugins seemingly have to be included in the build phase, a mechanism may be worked on
or not

And use at your own risk.
